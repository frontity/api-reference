# Build commands

These commands will allow you generate the code that can be used to run or analyze a Frontity project

* [`build`](build.md)

## The Build process

When you do [`npx frontity build`](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/build) you generate a `build` folder w/ several files.

You'll get something similar to this...

```text
├── build
│   ├── analyze
│   │   ├── module-development.html
│   │   └── server-development.html
│   ├── bundling
│   │   ├── chunks.module.json
│   │   └── entry-points
│   │       ├── server.ts
│   │       └── my-frontity-project
│   │           └── client.ts
│   ├── server.js
│   └── static
           ...
│       ├── xxxxx1.module.js
│       ├── xxxxx2.module.js
```

The most important file for deployments in any hosting is `server.js` that is actually a middleware that can be _inserted_ in a custom web server.

### How to execute a Frontity project in production after the build

#### `npx frontity serve`

You can directly execute this `server.js` by using the command [`npx frontity serve`](https://docs.frontity.org/frontity-cli/serve)

So, easy way of executing a Frontity project in any Node.js server

* launch remotely `npx frontity build` to generate the `build` folder
* launch remotely `npx frontity serve` to launch a web server that makes use of the `server.js` generated in the previous step

#### using `server.js` as a middleware

But you can also use this generated `server.js` as part of a custom server like it's mentioned [here](https://community.frontity.org/t/deploy-to-aws-lambda/814/8?u=juanma)

```text
// lambda.js
const awsServerlessExpress = require("aws-serverless-express");
const app = require("./build/server.js").default;
const server = awsServerlessExpress.createServer(app);

exports.handler = (event, context) => {
  awsServerlessExpress.proxy(server, event, context);
};
```

### The bundle analyzer

Frontity genereate some reports automatically by using [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer)

When doing `npx frontity build` you get a `build` folder in the root of your project

```text
├── build
│   ├── analyze
│   │   ├── module-development.html
│   │   └── server-development.html
│   ├── bundling
│   │   ├── chunks.module.json
│   │   └── entry-points
│   │       ├── my-frontity-project
│   │       │   └── client.ts
│   │       └── server.ts
│   ├── server.js
│   └── static
│       ├── my-frontity-project.module.js
│       └── list.module.js
```

Inside that `build` folder there is a `.html` file generated at `analyze/module-development.html` This file is a visual report in the form of a tree generated by [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer).

This report shows you the modules included on each bundle and the size of each one, so you can analyze them and maybe decide using other modules \(or not including a specific module at all\) to reduce the size of the final bundle
