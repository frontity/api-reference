⚠️ **Frontity Framework [is not under active development anymore.](https://frontity.org/blog/frontity-is-joining-automattic/)**

**The team is now working on [the WordPress Interactivity API](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/interactivity-api-dev-note/). This unblocks the same UX Frontity framework enabled but directly in WordPress Core, fully compatible with the new Site Editor.**

# Introduction

Welcome to Frontity, and to the API Reference documentation.

The Frontity documentation is distributed across three separate sites:

- [**docs.frontity.org**](https://docs.frontity.org) - Introduction, concepts and guides
- [**api.frontity.org**](https://api.frontity.org) - API Reference
- [**tutorial.frontity.org**](https://tutorial.frontity.org) - Step-by-step guide

This site \(api.frontity.org\) is where you will find detailed technical descriptions for the CLI, packages and plugins available in Frontity.

Let's kick things off by providing you with a roadmap so that you can find your way around the documentation and zero in on the information you need right now.

## Frontity CLI

In the [**CLI Commands**](frontity-cli/) section you'll find information about the commands provided by the Frontity CLI that you can use to create, run and build your Frontity projects.

## Packages

Frontity packages are the ingredients of your Frontity project. They're **NPM packages** in charge of a specific portion of logic required by the project \(routing, source, HTML render... \).

You can learn all about the existing Frontity packages in the section entitled [**Frontity Packages**](frontity-packages/).

### Themes Packages

Themes are just a special instance of a Frontity package. Really **everything** is a package when you're working with Frontity.

The official themes, namely `mars-theme` and `twentytwenty-theme`, are dealt with separately from the other packages under the [**Frontity Themes**](frontity-packages/themes-packages) section.

## Plugins

Sometimes a **Frontity WordPress plugin** is required so everything works smoothly. You'll find everything you need to know about them in the [**WordPress Plugins**](frontity-plugins/) section.
